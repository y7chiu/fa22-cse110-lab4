**1. Some JavaScript developers believe that most of the issues with JavaScript stem from its asynchronous nature, its loose typing, and the web platform it runs on. For each of the three reasons listed, explain in your own words why a developer might believe that it is a pain point.**

Answer:

Here are my thoughts of potential reasons:

- Asynchronous nature makes the development team spend more time to wait for the some parts to update suceesfully and get the function run normally. Other then many other languages, the javascript can only run one funnction at the time. We could not immediately see the result at once in the same time.

- Loose typing will make the error of distinguish the type of variables. For example, the string of number **1** will be converted into integer when comparing with integer 1 by using "**==**". Using "**===**" will be more confident for coders.

- The web platform the javascript runs on is like we need to run on the website and debug on the chrome console since it will not work if you just copy and paste on the vscode or other IDE compilers. The functions connects to other files and there are some libraries are provided for the website console.

**2. Related to the first question, why do you believe that the developer(s) who created JavaScript made it loosely typed? Why do you think they added asynchronous features?**

Answer: 

I believe the developers who created Javascript just want to make the code become convenient to use. Sometime, the feature of loosely typed could reduce the time in some specific project, especially the project that the type of variable is not too important. Also, they added asynchronous features is because making the front-end webpage is not just a single program to click and run. The webpage includes many feature that is independent to the other functions, and some features might need to do the previous feature to reach it, so asynchronous is kind of important for Javascript.

**3. What are the key differences between a compiled language and an interpreted one? Which one is JavaScript? What are the benefits & drawbacks of JavaScript being made that way?**

Answer:

Compile language is something that the computer need to compile to read by using compiler. If they don't do so, the computer will not able to understand the code. In this case, they can run synchronously, so the time will be quicker than the latter one. Interpreted language can directly make the code interpret and let the computer understand, but only can do one step at the time, which runs asynchronously. Javascript is the interpreted language. The drawback is that javascript function can only make one step at the time, and javascript use specific web to run itself. The benefits is stated above that make the code interpret.


**4. The professor believes that, though sometimes misused, JavaScript frameworks are incredibly powerful tools that can help teams work more efficiently and effectively. Given that, why do you believe he is focusing more on vanilla JavaScript for this course? What are the benefits of mastering vanilla JS first? What are the drawbacks of not learning a framework?**

Answer:

Learning other languages are useful and powerful, but they could be an individual work in the most of the time. Javascript is the code that really helps the developers to learn team work since they need to look for html to make and adjust the code to add the features. While you do the one small feature, Javascript can just write out one specific function related to that feature. This also help us to work systemly and schedulely. Not learning a framework might make the project look like chaos. All the flows and features are unorganized.


**5. Explain, in your own words, how you think this lab relates to your project. How might you be able to use this information in your own project?**

Answer:

This lab gets the introduction of javascript that has lots of realy powerful skills and features to learn. In the future project (or currently small project), especially the project that need front-end development, the javascript is the essential skill to make the web page to the operation like click in button, fill up informations, and transfer the user to other websites..., etc. Before the code starts, draw the code flow is also the important thing that can quickly help the team to get on right track.
